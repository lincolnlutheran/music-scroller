# Music Scroller
Scroll the score to a song across a browser window to promote group singing.

## In Action
Until I figure out why github pages isn't working, you can view the code in action at [laurenandlloyd.com/chorus](http://laurenandlloyd.com/chorus)

## Use
Put the files index.php and script.js in a directory. Create the directory /images in the same location and put the image file(s) of the score in that directory. Point your browser at index.php. You can use the space bar to pause the scrolling and the up/down arrows to control the speed.

## Options
To automatically control the speed of the score, you can cut the score image into different images. Indicate the order of the images by adding a number to the beginning of the image and indicate the speed by adding a number from 1-9:
